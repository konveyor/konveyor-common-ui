# useFormState

A custom hook for managing field values, validation, and other form state.
This is a simpler alternative to libraries like [Formik](https://formik.org/), built to minimize boilerplate and maximimize readability.
It includes full support for [TypeScript generics](https://www.typescriptlang.org/docs/handbook/generics.html); the types of values and function
parameters returned by `useFormField` and `useFormState` can be inferred from the `initialValue` passed to each `useFormField()`, or explicitly
passed as individual type parameters to each `useFormField<T>()`, or passed as a unified interface to the type parameter of `useFormState<T>()`.

This hook uses [yup](https://github.com/jquense/yup) for field validation, and its TypeScript signature enforces that each of your schema types is
compatible with its field type. `yup` is bundled as a dependency of `@konveyor/lib-ui`, but it is recommended that you also install `@types/yup` as a
devDependency in your app if you are using TypeScript.

We built this solution because we find that most forms do not have complex requirements, and libraries like Formik and co. tend to add unnecessary complexity.
We were burned by lots of confusing debugging sessions trying to figure out the reinitialization behavior of Formik, among other things,
and decided that it would be better to use something much simpler which we have total control of in-house. We have found that we can build forms
more quickly and with fewer headaches this way, and we hope others find it useful as well.

Note: this package also provides a [ValidatedTextInput component](./?path=/docs/components-validatedtextinput--pattern-fly-text-fields) to simplify rendering
PatternFly text fields driven by this hook.

## Types

```ts
function useFormField<T>(
  initialValue: T,
  schema: [T] extends [Array<infer E>] ? yup.ArraySchema<E> : yup.Schema<T>,
  options?: { initialTouched?: boolean }
): IFormField<T>;

function useFormState<TFieldValues>(
  fields: {
    // an object with values as useFormField calls
    [key in keyof TFieldValues]: IFormField<TFieldValues[key]>;
  },
  yupOptions?: yup.ValidateOptions
): IFormState<TFieldValues>;

interface IFormField<T> {
  value: T;
  setValue: React.Dispatch<React.SetStateAction<T>>;
  isDirty: boolean; // true if the value is different from initialValue by deep comparison
  isTouched: boolean;
  setIsTouched: (isTouched: boolean) => void;
  reset: () => void;
  schema: [T] extends [Array<infer E>] ? yup.ArraySchema<E> : yup.Schema<T>;
}

interface IValidatedFormField<T> extends IFormField<T> {
  error: yup.ValidationError | null;
  isValid: boolean;
}

interface IFormState<TFieldValues> {
  fields: {
    // The same fields object passed into useFormState, but with error and isValid properties added
    [key in keyof TFieldValues]: IValidatedFormField<TFieldValues[key]>;
  };
  values: TFieldValues; // For convenience in submitting forms (values are also included in fields property)
  isDirty: boolean; // true if any field has isDirty
  isValid: boolean; // true if every field has isValid
  reset: () => void;
  schema: yup.ObjectSchema | null; // In case you want to do anything fancy outside the hook
}
```

## Examples

### Basic text fields

In this example, the Name field is required and has a required length of 4 to 64 characters.
The Description field is optional, but has a maximum length of 128 characters.
When values matching these validation schema are entered, the Submit button will enable.
When invalid values are entered, a descriptive error will appear on the field when it loses focus.

Note: This example is given to demonstrate how custom fields with any markup can be built using this hook.
The below examples show how to use it with PatternFly components.

  <Story story={BasicTextFields} />
</Canvas>

### PatternFly text fields with explicit props

This form is the same as the above example, except using PatternFly's TextInput and TextArea instead of plain HTML elements.

Note: This example is given to demonstrate how custom PatternFly fields can be built using this hook.
The below example shows how to render these fields even more simply using helper components.

<Canvas>
  <Story story={PatternFlyTextFields} />
</Canvas>

### PatternFly text fields with prop helpers

This package also provides `getFormGroupProps`, `getTextInputProps` and `getTextAreaProps` helpers which can take a form field object
and return the necessary props to render PatternFly's FormGroup, TextInput and TextArea components.

Note: These helpers are provided for convenience if you need to build a custom field, you can reduce boilerplate even further by
using the [ValidatedTextInput component](./?path=/docs/components-validatedtextinput--pattern-fly-text-fields).

Most custom non-text fields can use `getFormGroupProps` even if the other helpers are not useful.

## TODO: better docs coming soon

This initial version is a copy of the implementation introduced in https://github.com/konveyor/virt-ui/pull/53 and enhanced in https://github.com/konveyor/virt-ui/pull/100.
I am adding it here so it can be reused more widely while it is being developed. Unit tests and better documentation will follow.

TODO:

- More examples with different types of fields, custom field types, etc.
- Better explanation of inferred types and variations with explicit type params used
- Unit tests
- Possible performance optimizations
- ???
