    NOTE: Please format your PR title (or your commit message, if there is only one commit) according to our semantic-release configuration. Your PR title (and resulting squashed commit message) must follow this syntax:

        type(scope): description

    The scope can be a filename or other short string explaining what part of the code you are touching. For example:

        feat(MyComponent): Added someProp for blah feature

    Valid types for a minor release (*.X.* version bump):
        feat - A new feature

    Valid types for a patch release (*.*.X version bump):
        fix - A bug fix
        docs - Documentation only changes
        style - Changes that do not affect the meaning of the code
        refactor - A code change that neither fixes a bug nor adds a feature
        perf - A code change that improves performance
        build - Changes that affect the build system or external dependencies
        revert - Reverts a previous commit
        test - Adding missing tests or correcting existing tests

    Valid types that do not trigger a release, but will end up in the next release notes:
        ci - Changes to our CI configuration files and scripts
        chore - Other changes that don't modify src or test files

    If your PR contains any breaking changes such as removing or renaming props, put the words BREAKING CHANGES somewhere in your PR description. This will trigger a major version bump (X.*.*).
